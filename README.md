## Bizfitech.Banking.Api

### To run the API:

1. clone the repo
2. set Bizfitech.Banking.Api.Web project as startup
3. f5
4. navigate to localhost:1143/swagger/ to manipulate the api


Currently only Fairway bank api is plugged in but same approach for any other bank; also would need to copy api client dll into web app bin, but fairway has just been statically added as a project ref, so it works without having to copy of dlls.
